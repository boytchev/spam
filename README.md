> Academic spam is the practice of sending unwanted email messages, promoting academic conferences, publishing opportunities, invitations to joining editorial boards and program committees.

This Spam project collects metadata from such academic spam sent to me. Non-academic spam about cat food, enlargement pills or being someone's next of a kin is not included. So far I've been spammed by 100+ journals, 100+ conference organizers and dozens of publishers. They, combined, used over 300 services and mail distribution sites.
