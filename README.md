## Spam IP addresses

This list contains sites that have sent me academic spam. They are blocked in my email filters. The web sites try to hide their domains, but the IP address or origin is found in the email header.
-->


# Criteria

Anything that makes me feel abused, forced, or cheated is included in this page. The criteria:

- Being added to **email lists** without my consent. The provision of [Unsubscribe] link does not change my opinion. I never use such links.
- Using **texts embedded in images**. This technique is used to bypass anti-spam filters. My email client filters out all images, unless they are from trusted sources. 
- Using **fake email address, domain or IP address**, especially if the public sender differs from the mail delivery route in the message header.
- **Mimicking legitimate sites**. This approach is used to diverge academic traffic (both papers and financial resources) to predators.
- Using **public emails** from gmail.com, yahoo.com, and so on. Serious academic events and publishers must have their own institutional emails.
- Using services for **mass emailing**. It doesn't matter whether some one does this honestly and in good faith. If it is done, I block the whole mail service.
- **Hiding links** in the text &ndash; i.e. the text link visible on the screen is different from the actual link.
- Using **trackers in links**. This is easily seen by some extra data attached to the link itself. I never click on such links. 
- Email from organization, publisher or event that I **do not know** and I **have never agreed** to get emails from them.
- **Beall's list**. If the sender is in this list, it will be blocked.
- Showing **misleading or custom ranking**, e.g. Impact Factors that are fake (yes, I check Web of Science), claims that something is indexed by Scopus, but it is not found there, using own ranking systems that mimic IF and SJR, but are not.
- Asking me to **review a paper** for a journal or to **join a program committee** of a conference, without establishing a proper contact with me and having my agreement.

Is it possible that some legitimate event or publication is wrongly included in this list? Yes, it is possible, but I do prefer to be on the safe side. If I cannot make myself sure within **2-3 minutes** that the message is trustful, this message is dropped out. I do not have the time to do a full scale research.
